# Proposal Pack Overview (Knowledge)

Core Principle:
- ChatGPT memory is NOT authoritative.
- The git repository is the single source of truth.

Anchor File:
- STATE.yaml governs opportunity status, ownership, deadlines, and locked decisions.

Required Artifact Categories:
- Solicitation artifacts (RFP, amendments, Q&A)
- Compliance artifacts (matrices, evaluation factors)
- Solution drafts (by volume)
- Teaming artifacts (criteria, scorecards, narratives)
- Review artifacts (Red Team, Kill Shot, integration)
- Pricing realism checks

Enforcement:
If an artifact is missing, the proposal is at risk. Stop and fix.
