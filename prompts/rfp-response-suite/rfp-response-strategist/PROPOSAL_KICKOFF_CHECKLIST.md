# Proposal Kickoff Checklist (RFQ/RFP)
Purpose: Prevent early mistakes that cause late-stage proposal failures.

This checklist must be completed **before drafting begins**.

---

## 1. Opportunity Sanity Check (GO / NO-GO)
☐ Solicitation type confirmed (RFQ / RFP / BPA / TO)  
☐ Contract vehicle verified  
☐ Set-aside / eligibility confirmed  
☐ Due date, time, and timezone confirmed  
☐ Submission method confirmed (portal/email/hard copy)  
☐ Page limits, font, margin rules captured  
☐ Amendments reviewed (none missing)

⛔ If any item is unclear → STOP

---

## 2. Repo & Artifact Setup
☐ New opportunity folder created (`proposal/<SOLICITATION_ID>/`)  
☐ `STATE.yaml` populated (owners, dates, vehicle, volumes)  
☐ `SOLICITATION_FILES.md` created and populated  
☐ Decision log initialized  
☐ Assumptions register initialized  
☐ Risk register initialized  

⛔ If STATE.yaml is incomplete → STOP

---

## 3. Compliance Readiness
☐ All solicitation documents ingested  
☐ All amendments accounted for  
☐ Compliance matrix started  
☐ All “shall” statements captured  
☐ Compliance ownership assigned  
☐ Compliance verification method defined  

⛔ Drafting before compliance = rework later

---

## 4. Evaluation Factor Understanding
☐ Section M (or equivalent) extracted  
☐ Factors and subfactors mapped  
☐ Hidden evaluator priorities identified  
☐ Kill-shot risks identified per factor  
☐ Evaluation factors documented in repo  

⛔ If you can’t explain how proposals are scored → STOP

---

## 5. Solution Feasibility Check
☐ Scope understood (what is actually being asked)  
☐ Required capabilities confirmed in-house or via partners  
☐ Staffing realism assessed  
☐ Schedule realism assessed  
☐ Security / clearance requirements confirmed  

⛔ If solution is aspirational, not executable → STOP

---

## 6. Teaming & Partnering Decision
☐ Capability gaps identified  
☐ Past performance gaps identified  
☐ Eligibility gaps identified  
☐ Partner criteria defined  
☐ Candidate partners shortlisted  
☐ Evidence requirements defined  

⛔ No logo teaming. Evidence or nothing.

---

## 7. Pricing & Cost Reality Check (Early)
☐ Contract type confirmed (FFP / T&M / CPFF / etc.)  
☐ Pricing instructions reviewed  
☐ Rough-order-of-magnitude pricing sanity checked  
☐ Staffing assumptions aligned with price  
☐ Known cost risks documented  

⛔ Price realism issues kill credibility early

---

## 8. Workflow & Roles Locked
☐ Proposal Manager assigned  
☐ Compliance Lead assigned  
☐ Teaming Lead assigned  
☐ Volume Leads assigned  
☐ Integrator assigned  
☐ Red Team identified  
☐ Review cadence scheduled  

⛔ Undefined ownership = missed deadlines

---

## 9. Review Strategy Agreed
☐ Compliance review scheduled  
☐ Red Team review planned  
☐ Kill Shot review planned  
☐ Time-boxed rewrite window reserved  

⛔ No reviews = evaluator finds the problems for you

---

## 10. GPT Usage Rules Confirmed
☐ Core drafting will use GovRFP-Collab-Strategist  
☐ Workflow governance will use GovRFP-ProposalOps  
☐ Required bootstrap artifacts will be loaded every session  
☐ Repo remains source of truth  

⛔ GPT misuse = inconsistent output

---

## Kickoff Exit Criteria (All Must Be True)
☐ Compliance matrix ≥ 80% populated  
☐ Evaluation factors clearly understood  
☐ Teaming strategy decided or in progress  
☐ Owners and deadlines locked  
☐ Drafting is authorized to begin  

If any box above is unchecked → **DO NOT START WRITING**
