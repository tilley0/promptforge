# Artifact Contract (Authoritative Inputs)
The GPT will treat the following as authoritative, per opportunity:
- STATE.yaml
- Compliance Matrix (md/xlsx/csv)
- Evaluation Factors (Section M) and Instructions (Section L)
- Current Draft Pointers

Everything else (chat, memory, ad-hoc notes) is non-authoritative unless copied into these artifacts.
