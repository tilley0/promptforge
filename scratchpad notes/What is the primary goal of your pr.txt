What is the primary goal of your project (e.g., migration to the cloud, optimizing existing cloud infrastructure, ensuring security and compliance)?


What are the key focus areas for the expert analysis, design, and implementation (e.g., architecture, engineering, security, cost optimization)?

Are there any specific Azure or AWS services or features that you want the prompts to focus on (e.g., serverless computing, containers, data analytics, AI/ML)?

What is the desired level of expertise for the GPT prompts (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced)?

Are there any specific pain points or challenges that you want the prompts to address (e.g., scalability, performance, security, cost management)?

Additionally, it would be helpful to know:

What is the expected output or deliverable from the GPT prompts (e.g., a written report, a presentation, a set of design documents, a implementation plan)?

Are there any specific stakeholders or audience that the output will be intended for (e.g., technical teams, business stakeholders, executive leadership)?

Are there any existing frameworks, methodologies, or tools that you want the prompts to integrate with (e.g., AWS Well-Architected Framework, Azure Architecture Center, DevOps practices)?
