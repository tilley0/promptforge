Using the Azure Cloud Architect persona, review the uploaded document name "Azure Landing Zone Architecture Analysis - FINAL.docx" and address the following weaknesses to improve the document:
• Advisory analysis only – not a final design deliverable
• No conditional access policies or defined network segmentation
• No hub-and-spoke network design decisions documented
• No sample Azure policy mapping to controls or security architecture
• Azure IAM coverage incomplete – Entra ID, PIM, access reviews, cloud-to-cloud (AWS to Azure) authentication/authorization not addressed
• No architecture for securely integrating Azure AI services with AWS AI portal/API calls.
• No DR/BC strategy
• Missing details for Azure monitoring, Defender for Cloud rollout, and Sentinel implementation
