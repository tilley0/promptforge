You are a Cloud Security Architect developing the baseline security plan for a government agency's Azure Landing Zone deployment to Azure Government against the FedRAMP High Customer Responsibility Matrix.  
The Azure Landing Zone implementation will be derived from the Microsoft missionLZ reference architecture and will be aligned with the best practices described in Microsoft's Cloud Adoption Framework and Azure Well Architected Framework.  The solution will consist of a Platform Landing Zone which will contain the management groups and subscriptions for the core shared services, and Application Zones, which will contain the Sandbox development management group and subscription, the AI/ML Services Management Group and subscriptions, and the Enterprise Workload Management group and subscription.  

The attached documents provide a comprehensive explanation of the design and implementation requirements. The "MVP and Done Requirements.docx" document outlines the requirements for the minimum viable product for ATO. The document named "LANL AZ - Azure network Architecture Plan - FiNAL.docx" describes the network connectivity design and the services that need to be implemented there.  The document named "LANL AZ - Azure Landing Zone Architecture Plane - FINAL.docx" describes the design of the Landing Zones and the services that will be implemented there. The document named "Azure Landing Zone Architecture Analysis - FINAL.docx" provides an analysis of the Landing Zone design and implementation plan against Microsoft's Cloud Adoption Framework and Azure Well Architected Framework.  The document "LANL AZ- Deployment Plan - FINAL.docx" describes the DevOps CI/CD Infrastructure-as-Code and Policy-as-Code approach for deploying, configuring, and maintaining the landing zones.  You need to develop a Security Implementation Plan for the Azure Government and Azure Commercial Landing Zone deployments.  The regulatory compliance requirements for the security plan are derived from NIST SP 800-53r5, SP 800.171r2, and FedRAMP High. The spreadsheet named "CRM-Local-Controls.xslx" contains a tab named "local-controls" which lists all of the local security controls that must be addressed in both the commercial and government landing zones.  

Using this information, create a hierarchical security plan, based on the described Management Group and subscription hierarchy, in which the policies applied to the Platform Landing Zone for all of the shared services provide foundational controls for the subsequent implementation of the Application Landing Zones. The Platform Zone will be the "Identity", "Management", and "Connectivity" management groups, and the Management Groups named "Sandbox", "AI/ML Services", and the "Enterprise Workload" will each be an Application Landing Zone. Management Groups. Provide a full detailed mapping of the "local-controls" for each landing zone and the respective services that are members of the zones and show how the Application Zones inherit protections from the Platform Zone. The policies should be derived from the Microsoft Built-In initiatives (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-initiatives?context=%2Fazure%2Fgovernance%2Fpolicy%2Fcontext%2Fpolicy-context) and Built-in policies (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies?context=%2Fazure%2Fgovernance%2Fpolicy%2Fcontext%2Fpolicy-context) and samples from the Microsoft Azure Offer Security Baselines 3.0 (https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines/3.0).  The NIST 800-53r5, 800-171r2, and FedRAMP High regulatory driven policies should be the primary references.
